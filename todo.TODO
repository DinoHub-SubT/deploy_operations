deploy:
  ☐ subt cloud terraform env needs to happen before cert??!?
  ☐ add in the "deployer questions" in the readme
  catkin build:
    ☐ catkin build all workspaces on localhost
        ☐ ugv sim not working
        ☐ multi robot simulation working
    ☐ catkin build all workspaces on azure
    ☐ catkin build all workspaces on robots: ugv
    ☐ catkin build all workspaces on robots: uav
  ☐ finish docker update for the perception stack on arm...
  ☐ create the gpu docker images (non-perception ones)
  ☐ build all cpu docker image types
  ☐ push all cpu docker images
  ☐ build all gpu docker image types
  ☐ push all gpu docker images
  ☐ push all catkin profiles to develop branches (its fine if they change later)
  ☐ compare old deployerbooks with new and make sure they are the same
  ☐ make sure remote ssh works (azure, robots)
  ☐ ugv simulation is not running...
  ☐ check uav multi simulation setup
  ☐ add uav map sharing rviz?
  ☐ make sure compute stick is still working...
  ☐ message Ian about previous bin scripts moved to scripts
  ☐ copy over basestation_utils here
  ☐ snapshot on skel_to, transfer remove snapshot
  ☐ wrong IPs in robot containers
  ☐ nvidia gpu config in user_configs, needs to be automatically set on robots
    - add deployer config for that? -- no make the INSTALLER find it!!!
  ☐ deployer command to run installer on remote
  ☐ if ROBOT is env var on computer, deployerbooks gets messed up....
  ☐ rename slam catkin profile from loam to slam
  ☐ nuc bashrc on localhost needs to add missing paramets for new subt_launch....

ansible:
  ☐ add hub (https://github.com/github/hub/releases/tag/v2.14.2) to the ansible install
  ✔ add the intel realsense install in payload install? @done(21-03-22 16:09)
  ✔ add intel MYRIAD install on host @done(21-03-22 16:09)
  ☐ @low ansible auto-generate ip scripts. To be used by scenarios TOO. Make it in ~/.subt env vars...
  ☐ subt localhost [ansible, prereq, validate] : checks for prereq requirements, validate all stuff is installed

readme:
  ☐ ansible failed with "password"
  ☐ ansible failed with "apt-get"
  ☐ copy bitbucket instructions from mmpug to deploy
  ☐ add the docker network part of the readme
    ✘ localhost (docker network) | azure (rm docker network) | robots (rm docker network) @cancelled(21-03-16 20:07)
    ☐ just add to readme -- double check

jenkins:
  ☐ jenkins: initial setup on azure
  ☐ jenkins: docker automated build, push to docker registry on subt room nuc
  ☐ jenkins: docker automated build (arm, xavier), push to docker registry on subt room nuc

subt_launch:
  ☐ add `pass_all_args="true" ` to all launch vars
  ☐ change ugv slam -> slam/robot, slam/devel, slam/common
  ☐ git hooks for ignore .catkin

  ☐ add a bootstrap script, that runs any commands before starting the docker container
  ☐ uav launch, requires sleep...
  ☐ subt_launch -- second setup, launch file cleanup
  ☐ pull in the auto-create desktop icons

nice-to-haves:
  ☐ when operations changes are done, then change the file
    - when the file has changes, then update all operations
  ☐ similar with ansible, have a invisible file for the trigger of automated updates
  ☐ move the .terraform files to ~/.subt
  ☐ automate ssh azure_vpn key, move to ~/.ssh/azure, automate adding to config --> ansible
  ☐ add a visualization of repo state (with branches, not just commit hashes)
    - fix the snapshot script
  ☐ git hooks (post-checkout): to check versions of operations and prompt for update
  ☐ add a `subt git sync`
    - reset, pull should not remove uncomitted changes
  ☐ add a `subt git status`: prints status nicely?
  ☐ add a 'rm registry', to remove a image from azure registry command
  ☐ add nuc as docker registry
  ☐ no IPs in config file
